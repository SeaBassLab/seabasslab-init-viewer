## tl;dr

- Install by executing `npm i seabasslab-init-viewer` or `yarn add seabasslab-init-viewer`.
- Import by adding `import { initViewer } from 'seabasslab-init-viewer'`.
- Use by adding this function `initViewer(config)`.
- Use `onMount` because it needs to run on client side.

## Description

seabasslab-init-viewer is a small browser-oriented library that allows you to manipulate the Sketchfab Viewer API simply and easily.

## Motivation

With the strong demand for 3D models on the web. Sketchfab has become an important benchmark for many reasons, one of which is connecting a 3D viewer to an iframe tag. I have personally had to work on several projects where it was necessary to implement and modify the API viewer. Hide a button, add a custom payload, custom icon, etc.
The hard part is implementing the Sketchfab client in projects with server-side rendering.ü§í
These and other common API viewer configuration errors that consume research time and cause us some headaches. This package will be handling them üëçüèª. So enjoy it üôåüèº!!!

## Getting started

### Installation

Add seabasslab-init-viewer to your project by executing

```js
 npm install seabasslab-init-viewer
```

or

```js
 yarn add seabasslab-init-viewer
```

### Usage

Here's an example of basic usage:

- Add a container

```html
<main id="1-iframe-container">
  <!-- <div id="loader">Loading!</div> -->
</main>
```

- Initialize the viewer

  ```js
  import { initViewer } from "@ibisdev/init-viewer";
  import { onMount } from "svelte";

  const config = {
    model_uid: "a47b60046a9b45b9a465af72fac78deb", // required
    container_id: "1-iframe-container", // required
    request_settings: [
      // optional
      {
        name: "getMaterialList",
        arguments: [],
      },
      {
        name: "getTextureList",
        arguments: [],
      },
      {
        name: "setTextureQuality",
        arguments: ["hd"],
      },
    ],
  };

  onMount(async () => {
    initViewer(config, (data) => {
      console.log(data); // data is the value for the request_settings response
    });
  }); // needs to run on the client side

  updateSettings("1-iframe-container", {
    name: "startAR",
    arguments: [],
  });
  ```

# InitViewer

## Config

- `model_uid`: It refers to the identification of the 3D model previously uploaded in Sketchfab

- `container_id`: Refers to the id of the HTML tag container

- `request_settings`: It is an array of objects containing 2 properties. The function name and arguments(if it takes no arguments, pass an empty array)

## Callback

- Receives a response to functions in request_settings and/or updateSettings

## Function - updateSettings

Receives 2 arguments. The first is a string with the id of the `HTML` container tag and the second is an object equal to the objects in request_settings. This function allows you to manipulate the 3D model without having to start it again.

## TypeScript

- This library comes with TypeScript "typings". If you happen to find any bugs in those, create an issue.

## Options

- Option parameters for the 3D viewer

You will probably need to interact with the different options provided by the Sketchfab viewer API itself. Many of the options have account limitations.
Please visit the [official site](https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer/initialization) to know all the options

having said that...

You can control the different aspects of the model viewer by passing as a third parameter (optional) an object with the values allowed by the Sketchfab Viewer API

```js
onMount(async () => {
  initViewer(
    config,
    (data) => {
      console.log(data);
    },
    { autospin: 0.2 }
  ); // read on for possible values and uses
});
```
