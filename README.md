## tl;dr

- Install by executing `npm install seabasslab-init-viewer` or `yarn add seabasslab-init-viewer`.
- Import by adding `import { init_viewer } from 'seabasslab-init-viewer'`.
- Use by adding this function `init_viewer(<your iframe>,<sketchfab model UID>)`.
- Use `useEffect`or `onMount` because it needs to run on client side.

## Description

seabasslab-init-viewer is a small browser-oriented library that allows you to manipulate the Sketchfab Viewer API simply and easily.

## Motivation

With the strong demand for 3D models on the web. Sketchfab has become an important benchmark for many reasons, one of which is connecting a 3D viewer to an iframe tag. I have personally had to work on several projects where it was necessary to implement and modify the API viewer. Hide a button, add a custom payload, custom icon, etc.
The hard part is implementing the Sketchfab client in projects with server-side rendering.ü§í
These and other common API viewer configuration errors that consume research time and cause us some headaches. This package will be handling them üëçüèª. So enjoy it üôåüèº!!!

## Getting started

### Installation

Add seabasslab-init-viewer to your project by executing `npm install seabasslab-init-viewer` or `yarn add seabasslab-init-viewer`.

### Usage

Here's an example of basic usage:

- Add an empty iframe
```html
    <iframe
        src=""
        title='api-iframe'
        allow="autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking"
        height="700px"
        xr-spatial-tracking
        execution-while-out-of-viewport
        execution-while-not-rendered
        web-share
        allowfullscreen
        bind:this={iframe}
    >
    </iframe>
```
- Insert this script inside your page:
```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.sketchfab.com/api/sketchfab-viewer-1.12.1.js"></script>
```
- Initialize the viewer
    
    ```js
    import { init_viewer } from 'seabasslab-init-viewer';
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';

    export /**
    * @type {string}
    */
    let model_uid

    export /**
    * @type {HTMLIFrameElement}
    */
    let iframe

    onMount(async () => init_viewer(iframe, model_uid)); // needs to run on the client side
    ```
## Alternatives

You will probably need to interact with the different options provided by the Sketchfab viewer API itself. Many of the options have account limitations.
Please visit the [official site](https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer/initialization) to know all the options

having said that...

You can control the different aspects of the model viewer by passing as a third parameter (optional) an object with the values allowed by the Sketchfab Viewer API

```js
onMount(async () => init_viewer(iframe, model_uid, {autospin: 0.2})); // read on for possible values and uses
```
